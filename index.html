    It looks like you mentioned "string." Are you referring to a string in programming,
    a specific kind of string, or something else? 
        
   Strings are for storing text
   Strings are written with quotes

   Example:-
          let text = "John Doe"
        </pre>
        <h3>String concatenation</h3>
        <pre>
            var string1 = "prep";
            var string2 = "Bytes";
            var string3 = string1 + string2;
            console.log(string3);
        </pre>
        <h3>string concatenation</h3>
        <pre>
    The concat() method joins two or more strings.
    The concat() method does not change the existing strings.
    The concat() method returns a new string.
    Example
    var string1 = "prep";
    var string2 = "Bytes";
    var string3 = string1 + string2;
    console.log(string3);
    </pre>    
    <h3>main method of string concatenation</h3>
        <pre>
        let str1 = "hello";
        let str2 = "world";
        let res1 = str1.concat(str2);
        console.log(res1);
        </pre>
<h3>Slice()</h3>
<pre>
    The slice() method extracts a part of a string.
    The slice() method returns the extracted part in a new string.
    The slice() method does not change the original string.
    The start and end parameters specifies the part of the string to extract.
    The first position is 0, the second is 1, ...
    A negative number selects from the end of the string.
    Example
    let string = "heyy....sab log camera on kar lo.... camera.....";
    let result = str.slice(10, 25);
    console.log(result)
</pre>
<h3> Substring()</h3>
<pre>
    The substring() method extracts characters, between two indices (positions), from a string, and returns the substring.
    The substring() method extracts characters from start to end (exclusive).
    The substring() method does not change the original string.
    If start is greater than end, arguments are swapped: (4, 1) = (1, 4).
    Start or end values less than 0, are treated as 0.
    substring does not support negative index For substr second parameter in length.
    Example
    let str5 = "you will be an amazing develop";
    let str6 = str5.substring(5, 7);
    console.log(str6)
</pre>
<h3>Replace()</h3>
<pre>
    The replace() method searches a string for a value or a regular expression.
    The replace() method returns a new string with the value(s) replaced.
    The replace() method does not change the original string.
    Example
    let str10= "sharma";
    //let res10 = str.replace(" ","/");
    let res11 = str10.replace("h","i");
    console.log(res11);

    let stringb = "heyy....sab log camera on kar lo.... camera.....";
    let res4 = str.trim();
    console.log(res4);
</pre>
<h3>split</h3>

    The split() method splits a string into an array of substrings.
    The split() method returns the new array.
    The split() method does not change the original string

    Example
    let string5 = "heyy....sab log camera on kar lo.... camera.....";
